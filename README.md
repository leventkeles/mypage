My portfolio site that I coded with Tailwind CSS using NextJs in 2022. At that time, NextJs and Tailwind CSS were just starting to become known, and especially after using Tailwind CSS at that time, I predicted that it would leave other CSS libraries in the dark. Because I have examined many CSS libraries and none of them were as useful as Tailwind CSS. Nowadays, the Shadcn UI component library has started to shine, I recommend you to check it out :)
